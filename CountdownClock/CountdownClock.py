# COUNTDOWN CLOCK
# User to inputs time and date
# Program will print out a message at given intervals, telling user how much longer there is until the selected time

# SUBGOALS
# If the selected time has already passed, have the program tell the user to start over.
# Asks for the year, month, day, hour separately, allow the user to type in either the month name or its number.
# Use of built in modules such as time and datetime can change this project from a nightmare into a much simpler task.
